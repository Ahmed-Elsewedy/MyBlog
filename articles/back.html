                The back end refers to parts of a
                computer application or a program's
                code that allow it to operate and that
                cannot be accessed by a user. Most data
                and operating syntax are stored and accessed
                in the back end of a computer system. Typically
                the code is comprised of one or more programming
                languages.

                The back end is also called
                the data access layer of software
                or hardware and includes any functionality
                that needs to be accessed and navigated to
                by digital means.

                A back-end application or program
                supports front-end user services,
                and interfaces with any required
                resources. The back-end application
                may interact directly with the front
                end or it may be called from an
                intermediate program that mediates
                front-end and back-end activities.
