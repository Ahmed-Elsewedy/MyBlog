                Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of
                computer science concerned with building smart machines
                capable of performing tasks that typically require human
                intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with
                multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning
                and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually
                every sector of the tech industry.

                Artificial intelligence allows machines
                to model, and even improve upon, the capabilities
                of the human mind. From the development of self-driving
                cars to the proliferation of smart assistants like Siri
                and Alexa, AI is a growing part of everyday life. As a
                result, many tech companies across various industries
                are investing in artificially intelligent technologies.

                AI is a computer system able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence ... Many of
                these artificial intelligence systems are powered by machine learning, some of them are powered by deep
                learning and some of them are powered by very boring things like rules.
