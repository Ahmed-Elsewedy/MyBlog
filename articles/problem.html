                Problem solving is the process of achieving a goal by overcoming obstacles, a frequent part of most
                activities. Problems in need of solutions range from simple personal tasks (e.g. how to turn on an
                appliance) to complex issues in business and technical fields.

                Solutions require sufficient resources and knowledge to attain the goal. Professionals such as lawyers,
                doctors, and consultants are largely problem solvers for issues which require technical skills and
                knowledge beyond general competence.

                There are many specialized problem-solving techniques and methods in fields such as engineering,
                business, medicine, mathematics, computer science, philosophy, and social organization. The mental
                techniques to identify, analyze, and solve problems are studied in psychology and cognitive sciences.
                Additionally, the mental obstacles preventing people from finding solutions is a widely researched
                topic: problem solving impediments include confirmation bias, mental set, and functional fixedness.
